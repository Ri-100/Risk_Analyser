## Methodology  

1. Data Analysis: 
   - Conducted comprehensive loan data analysis to uncover patterns in loan status, borrower characteristics, and loan terms.  
   - Identified key factors affecting loan defaults, including loan amount, interest rates, and credit history.  

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Applied Weight of Evidence (WOE) and Information Value (IV) techniques to select the most impactful features.  
   - Preprocessed and transformed raw data for model training.  

3. Model Development:
   - Built a predictive model using Logistic Regression with L2 regularization.  
   - Optimized hyperparameters for maximum predictive performance.  


## Evaluation  

**Model Performance**:  
   - Achieved an AUC-ROC score of **0.93**, indicating excellent predictive capability.  
   - Recorded an **accuracy of 94.09%** and **precision of 85%** in loan classification.
